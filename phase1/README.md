# LogicPL-Pahse1
During this phase, our team successfully developed the lexical and semantic analyzers for the LogicPL language utilizing the ANTLR framework. These analyzers play a crucial role in processing and understanding LogicPL code. For more details about this phase, please refer to the `LogicPL_Phase1.pdf` file located in the "docs" folder.

Furthermore, significant progress was made in enhancing the functionality of our `grammar.g4` file. Specifically, we incorporated actions into the grammar rules to facilitate the printing of parse tree nodes in a pre-order traversal manner. This strategic implementation provides valuable insights into the structure of the LogicPL code during parsing.

For comprehensive details on the implementation process and to better understand the LogicPL language's syntactic and semantic elements, please refer to `LogicPL_Phase1.pdf` file located in "docs" folder and our codebase.

## Test Cases
Our test cases for this phase are located within the `test_cases`` folder. To validate the functionality of the implemented lexical and semantic analyzers, follow these steps:

1. [Run](https://github.com/SamanEN/LogicPL-Compiler/edit/main/phase1/README.md#how-to-run) the program with the provided test cases.
2. Compare the program's output with the corresponding test*-ans.txt file.

Ensuring that the program's output closely matches the content of the associated answer file demonstrates the accurate performance of the lexical and semantic analyzers. This validation process guarantees the correct parsing and analysis of LogicPL language constructs. For detailed test case execution instructions, consult our [documentation](https://github.com/SamanEN/LogicPL-Compiler/edit/main/phase1/README.md#how-to-run).
