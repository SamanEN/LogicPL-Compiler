# LogicPL-Phase4: Adding Code Generator to LogicPL Compiler

## Overview
In this phase of the LogicPL compiler project, we will be implementing a Code Generator. The Code Generator's primary task is to traverse the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by the previous phases of the compiler and produce Jasmine Assembly code. This generated code will be saved to a file with the same name as the input file but with a `.class` extension.

## Project Structure
To facilitate this phase, we have added `ByteCode` files to the project, which are located in the `byteCode` folder within the `src` folder.

## Test Cases
To validate the functionality of the implemented code generator, we have defined a set of test cases located within the `test_cases` folder. These test cases cover a range of operations and features, including:

- **Main Function**: Ensure that the main function is correctly generated.
- **Function Calls**: Verify that function calls are correctly translated into Jasmine Assembly code.
- **Variable Declaration**: Support integer variable declarations.
- **Variable Assignment**: Ensure that assigning values to variables is properly translated.
- **Operations**: Handle operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, logical AND, and logical OR.
- **Assignment Statements**: Translate assignment statements to Jasmine Assembly.
- **Return Statements**: Generate Jasmine Assembly for return statements.
- **Extra Features**: Support additional features like array declaration, array assignment, and variable declaration for float, bool, and arrays.

**Note**: Extra features are the features that are not required in the project description but our team decided to implement them to make the compiler more robust.

## Running the Program
To run the LogicPL compiler with the Code Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA**: Open the project using IntelliJ IDEA (IntelliSense is recommended).

3. **Run the Program**: Execute the program with the provided test cases.

4. **View Generated Code**: Examine the generated Jasmine Assembly code and validate its correctness.

5. *(Optional)* **Run Generated Code with Jasmin**: If desired, you can run the generated Jasmine Assembly code with Jasmin to see the program's output.

## Running the Generated Code
To run the Jasmine Assembly code generated by the LogicPL compiler, follow these steps:

1. **Download Jasmin**: Download Jasmin from [here](http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/download.html).

2. **Extract Jasmin**: Extract the downloaded Jasmin archive to a convenient location on your machine.

3. **Navigate to Jasmin Folder**: Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted Jasmin.

4. **Compile Generated Code**: Run the following command to compile the generated code (replace `<generated_code_file_name>` with your actual file name):
   ```
   java -jar jasmin.jar <generated_code_file_name>.j
   ```

5. **Run Generated Code**: Execute the following command to run the generated code:
   ```
   java <generated_code_file_name>
   ```

6. **Check Output**: Check the output of the program to verify its correctness.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the LogicPL compiler successfully generates Jasmine Assembly code and that the generated code produces the expected results when executed.
